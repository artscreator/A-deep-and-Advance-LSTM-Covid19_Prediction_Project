The year 2020 was a catastrophic year for humanity. Pneumonia of unknown aetiology was first reported in December 2019., since then, COVID-19 spread to the whole world and became a global pandemic. More than 200 countries were affected due to pandemic and many countries were trying to save precious lives of their people by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, social distances, event postponements and lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. However, due to lackadaisical attitude, efforts attempted by the governments were jeopardised, thus, predisposing to the wide spread of virus and lost of lives. 

The scientists believed that the absence of AI assisted automated tracking and predicting system is the cause of the wide spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the scientist proposed the usage of deep learning model to predict the daily COVID cases to determine if travel bans should be imposed or rescinded 

This is a task to create a deep learning model using LSTM neural network to predict new cases (cases_new) in Malaysia using the past 30 days of number of cases.
